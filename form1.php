            <p> <b>DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone.</b></p>
            <p><b>The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), 
            and thymine (T).</b></p>
            <p><b> Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people.</b></p>
            <p><b>An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself,
            Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases.</b></p>

              <p> <b>A protein is a naturally occurring, extremely complex substance that consists of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds.

             <p><b>Proteins are present in all living organisms and include many essential biological compounds such as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies.</b></p>
             <p><b> There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to make a protein.</b></p>

                    but a small number of genes (less than 1 percent of the total) are slightly different between people.</b></p>
